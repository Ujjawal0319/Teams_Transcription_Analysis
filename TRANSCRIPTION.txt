00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.590
Himadri Lala
OK, so this subject was there previously also, but from this year onwards we have changed this flavor symmetry with for the students convenience and previously it used to be triple E 1004. Now if you want to check the hold.
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:27.470
Himadri Lala
Old materials, then you have to go for triple E 10044 states. Otherwise from this year onwards the the code has changed to be tricky to instigate to north.
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.150
Himadri Lala
What we got from this electrical engineering I think, I think all of you are from select school only.
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.530
Himadri Lala
Like giving number is 615 years I think. So maybe meeting in person.
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.480
Himadri Lala
This is the main idea I have to face any problem. You can mail me otherwise you can also contact me through Ms teams.
00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:11.100
Himadri Lala
And these are the timings you can come OK and apart from this also if you face any problem and if you want to discuss something or something so definitely you can come to my cabin after coming back to this campus. OK so this is all about.
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.530
Himadri Lala
My details.
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.140
Himadri Lala
First of all, first of all the course outcomes.
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:39.810
Himadri Lala
Now, uh, I think all of you might have already studied few things. Outlet OK, at least. So it is basically a combination of liquid statics and magnetism. OK, just look at the course outcomes for first outcome, says the identifier and implement an appropriate codec system, forgiven elected binary curing problems.
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.020
Himadri Lala
So basically we have to.
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:59.080
Himadri Lala
Cuz of appropriate coordinate system for each and every kind of electromagnetic field problems. OK, the second course outcomes says apply concepts of electrostatics or application related to electric fields. OK so it is basically related to the electrostatics.
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:09.000
Himadri Lala
Heard what flex incidents of magnetostatics or computing parameters with magnetic field? So it is entirely.
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.070
Himadri Lala
Related to magnetostatics.
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:22.660
Himadri Lala
4th one is, uh, concepts of electrodynamic fields and apply Maxwell's equation we lifted by writing here, so this this part entirely is.
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.770
Himadri Lala
Electromagnetism.
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.870
Himadri Lala
We get to Magnus.
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.370
Himadri Lala
I keep one is basically the major applications magnetic waves and electromagnetism overall.
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:46.460
Himadri Lala
But if you just look at the quotes outcome, so first outcomes for worst outcome is related to the coordinate system and along with that it also comes with it period.
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.240
Himadri Lala
OK, this is Victor.
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.940
Himadri Lala
As you go up the vector also we need to understand a little bit.
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.130
Himadri Lala
No no.
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.980
Himadri Lala
Appropriate coordinate system along with vectors. Then these other tools. Basically we we.
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:11.600
Himadri Lala
Uh, it it will be useful for you to solve the electrostatics problem. Magnetostatic hand electromed.
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:44.360
Himadri Lala
OK, the first model is basically vertical analysis. We are so in that vector analysis itself we will also study their coordinate systems. Now generally what we have we have supposed rectangular coordinate system that will be used. But in this case we will be also studying some other kinds of coding system like ceiling vehicles, coordinate systems so we can coordinate system like that also and how to transform the code make systems that also will study.
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.390
Himadri Lala
Now, syllables, syllables.
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.820
Himadri Lala
Getting 1/2 is electrostatics, so we are directly moving towards the second coats out. This is this is Co.
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.310
Himadri Lala
Course outcome 2.
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:19.760
Himadri Lala
In this we will be studying will be studying the basic costs. Clinical studies then goes all these things. You would study over here and wrap plus persons equation and boundary condition here. Mostly mostly will be focusing on the capacitance calculations. How we calculate the capacity and based on the electrostatic fields.
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:26.510
Himadri Lala
I need a quick chat, so yeah, maybe that final outcome is capacities. Being more concerned about that.
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:40.050
Himadri Lala
About the Pennsylvania. How we just look at this node module, which is the magnetic static field, so magnetostatic so it will it will be dealing with similar kinds of similar kinds workloads, but here the log will be studying.
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.360
Himadri Lala
Why so much? Love can also manually boundary condition MK surgical love each other.
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:58.080
Himadri Lala
Basically, starting in this model OK and finally our outcome will be the inductance calculation. So we're we're talking about C.
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.380
Himadri Lala
Because we both work.
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.570
Himadri Lala
Inductance calculation and finally we are having Maxwell's equation.
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:13.960
Himadri Lala
And I'm very pleased so everything will be studying over here regarding the faradays law and this law, Maxwell's inclusion and basically.
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:25.240
Himadri Lala
After I after reading all these laws, why we are going for Maxwell's equation and what does it mean? To what is it something new or this is the similar kind of approach work we have studied earlier?
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.230
Himadri Lala
Those things works understand, along with the implication of.
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.140
Himadri Lala
Electromagnetic induction or electromagnetism?
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.730
Himadri Lala
And this is.
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.760
Himadri Lala
Similar part which is deleted.
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:49.380
Himadri Lala
Did we get to my meeting waves? So here we are, starting the electromagnetic wave propagation and in different different types of dielectric sandwich condiments OK?
00:05:50.040 --> 00:06:00.540
Himadri Lala
And sometimes it will be lossy dielectrics. Sometimes it will be lossless dielectric. So all those things will be studying in model and Model 6 is dedicated to the applications of electromagnetics.
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:12.200
Himadri Lala
Without electrical boards, instrumentation bag and also instruments in background will be studying at least two to applications from each.
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:13.600
Himadri Lala
Makes department.
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.620
Himadri Lala
OK.
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:31.860
Himadri Lala
And most of these modules 6 and Model 7 will be covered by us along with some industry experts and also some some other Fagot results we ever has expertise in certain research domain so they will come and they will be with us.
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.200
Himadri Lala
OK, so these are the outlines of the syllabus.
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.780
Himadri Lala
Now.
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:53.290
Himadri Lala
The first thing, so always whenever you are you are seeing is delivered. Sir, I'm teaching you something, so always whenever you are trying with this, any of the subjects means ask yourself three questions. First is what?
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.250
Himadri Lala
How is your study?
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.280
Himadri Lala
Final and the most important question is wildly.
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:22.580
Himadri Lala
So now the question is so by basically we are studying this correct language. Very obviously we can also qualitative going to be preparing or engineering left magnetics like that previously. The name used to be engineering electric.
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:23.520
Himadri Lala
OK.
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.410
Himadri Lala
So why inactive?
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.070
Himadri Lala
We need this site so we should now.
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.310
Himadri Lala
If you just look at Ian empty.
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:56.990
Himadri Lala
So if you just look around in physical universe, there are four kinds of basic courses we have in our physical universe. Now they are. They can be some strong posts like nuclear post, some weak force like radioactive decay and it can be electromagnetic force and also it can be gravitational. It's not apart from just over K. We can comment that gravitational force is very.
00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:06.060
Himadri Lala
Angel, it's a very strong force, but it is not electromagnetic forces about tentative out 36 times the gravitational force.
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.800
Himadri Lala
So this is the truth we have.
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.740
Himadri Lala
So.
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:28.400
Himadri Lala
We need to manually force is very much strong, so it's very elegant for artistically diverse and we should know we should know everything about OK and this basically it is basically that particular course which is forcing the atoms to stick together and make a matter.
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:37.630
Himadri Lala
So main cause of matter sticking together is basically I found somebody put something behind that the electromagnetic force OK.
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:52.030
Himadri Lala
About electromagnetic emission. Why this subject that we understood that there will be electromagnetic posts is very important in physical universe. But why we're studying this subject means earlier, I think some of you.
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.170
Himadri Lala
No, we have actually all of you have sent basically left again.
00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:57.640
Himadri Lala
Plus the Mr.
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.550
Himadri Lala
All set or electric circuits.
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:01.340
Jai B
Yes.
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.140
Anamika Shaoke
Basic electronics.
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.790
Jai B
Basic collectibles
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.450
Himadri Lala
Basically like tronics basic electronics, some of you already have basically trickle.
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.180
Jai B
Yep.
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:10.520
Himadri Lala
So.
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:21.320
Himadri Lala
So apart from that, I think this probably in next industry will also study this circuit theory. Now what is the basic difference making electromagnetic theory and circuit theory?
00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:30.600
Himadri Lala
The basic difference is the outlook is circuit theory or whatever. Maybe it's the inner thing is basically electromagnetic field.
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:47.220
Himadri Lala
It's whatever is suppose. Suppose there is a capacity complete, has the capacity. Now why this capacity to keep particles is there? Why this story charge not? Suppose we we we say that the capacitor, inductor surface devices? OK now why why it is?
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:58.930
Himadri Lala
But in practice, we will. We will not be discussing all these things will be discussing will be more focused on what is the value of north, what is the value of C and what we can make use of it.
00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:05.090
Himadri Lala
Like how we can build or inductor and if you want to build a inductor what we do is fication.
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:09.840
Himadri Lala
And what kind of suppose in a capacitor? What kind of late to study field should be there?
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:10.840
Himadri Lala
Thank you.
00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:14.720
Himadri Lala
People are passing through those things usually will understandably.
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:20.640
Himadri Lala
The background background of electrical communication instrumentation is pretty easily.
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:28.460
Himadri Lala
If you look at the machine so that that machine is working with electromagnetic induction.
00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:39.480
Himadri Lala
OK, so everywhere everywhere we have Activision, whatever kind of communication you will see. All the communications are comes under electromagnetic field.
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.360
Himadri Lala
OK, so everything will be discussing.
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:59.350
Himadri Lala
That little gradually let me just look at what what is electromagnetic. So basically study of effect of charges at rest and motion. So at risk means electrostatics and motion means it can be magnetostatics or electromagnetics.
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:26.410
Himadri Lala
And also application of electric and magnetic field. So whenever lectric field and magnetic field combines together it makes electromagnetic fields OK. So to study that so basically we need the electromagnetic and electrical engineering is basically nothing but applied electromagnetics. So whichever subjective field goal which I got copied key features, it is basically applied mathematics heater, circuit theory.
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:48.470
Himadri Lala
Need a TV and KCL current resistance capacitance, inductance, voltage, electric and magnetic energy, power electric machines, antennas, wave propagation, optics, optical computing, whatever. Maybe it is. It is basically applied electromagnetics, means the manifestation in other subjects can be different. But what inner part is basically implied it?
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.090
Himadri Lala
OK, so.
00:11:51.950 --> 00:12:06.260
Himadri Lala
And uh, for we can also say that all the communication systems like micro communication, optical fiber, satellite communication, TV there are antenna, optical computing or whatever. Maybe it is so it is basically.
00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.420
Himadri Lala
Patient here it is electromagnetic.
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:11.710
Himadri Lala
Which is working in the background.
00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:43.830
Himadri Lala
Now now showing this so so there is one more point I think I missed that at devices get smaller and smaller frequencies get higher and higher. So as long as we are we are using high frequencies. So basically at high very high frequency transmission line and guided wave theory must be used at high speed electronics and micro nanoelectronics integrated circuits. So these are the basic fields which basically uses high frequencies and these.
00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.560
Himadri Lala
I frequency that really.
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.080
Himadri Lala
Just just wait a minute.
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.210
Himadri Lala
Just give me a minute.
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:05.180
Himadri Lala
OK, sorry for the interruption, just know I love it.
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:37.410
Himadri Lala
OK, so we were discussing about high frequencies now how how? What are the frequency range we have now if you just look at this frequency band, it is called the electromagnetic spectrum means if the electromagnetic spectrums starts completely over then it goes up to 30 megahertz, 30,000 megabytes. OK, so it has different different levels, like very low frequency, low frequency. Then we have medium frequency then shortwaves.
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.710
Himadri Lala
It is between.
00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.110
Himadri Lala
So Reddy, Miguel, but we are very bad.
00:14:41.940 --> 00:15:01.100
Himadri Lala
I'll try it again and finally the Super high frequencies are all these things so we can see that in different different frequency ranges. Basically we are handling some other kind of communication like satellite satellite communication that teardrop casting. So for these other for the TV channels then for the FM radio.
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:13.610
Himadri Lala
OK then CB radio channels, then in radio broadcast. So all this thing basically all this total frequency band whatever we have so we can use a different different applications OK?
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.750
Himadri Lala
Now so high frequency. What is the reason and?
00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:33.930
Himadri Lala
Uh, so that we have already discussed. Now if you just look at the basic three elements we have in our in all the electric circuits, so basically our else. So everything can be designed with R&C.
00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:45.790
Himadri Lala
And then, the, uh, the theory behind the RNC is means, how can we change it? How the size of the inductor or capacitor decides?
00:15:46.160 --> 00:16:01.510
Himadri Lala
Of inactivity and all the capacity capacity so everything is comes from the lap listened poison situation, which is the part of which is essential part of what the electromagnetism or electromagnetic field.
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:14.090
Himadri Lala
And we learn analytic method for solving such equations for symmetrical configuration in this course, and to be supplemented by numerical methods for a more general case.
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.780
Himadri Lala
And a chicken.
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:47.540
Himadri Lala
To summarize, so basically the yeah we use field theory to estimate the circuit parameters or else on which the circuit theorems can be applied. Means whatever circuit theorems or last suppose we are using supposed theorems, superposition theorem theorem or Khush. Anything which can be applied on our else. But to estimate the circuit parameters means what will be the value of what will be the value of L.
00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:54.200
Himadri Lala
Or C or and how? How it is going to happen? This thing will come from electromagnetic fields.
00:16:55.790 --> 00:17:05.490
Himadri Lala
OK, and uh, at high frequencies with just a small note, a high frequencies that resistance of a conductor increases depending on its shape.
00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:32.470
Himadri Lala
So these are a few few things. Basically, will be handling and for for electrical engineers means we have Tripoli students also here and in Tripoli students. It is also a huge means whatever you will be seeing it can be electrical machine. It can be anything, anything which is great. If electrical engineering whatever is happening behind that is basically that Umm.
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:47.650
Himadri Lala
OK, that can be magnetic field that can be studied field that can be charged. That can be tricky. Magnetic induction everything comes under, it can be powered electronics that can convert us whatever we are using. Basically it comes from.
00:17:49.860 --> 00:18:19.680
Himadri Lala
The book I'm referring over here is elements of electromagnetics called Matthew and so right now I think 7th EDITION has come, so I request all of you if you can buy this book, that's absolutely fine. I think it needs P-350 or 400, which is only and it is very useful for you as long as you are, you are electrical engineering student because it is going to stay means whenever you will be having some kind of confusion that can be in machine that can be involved in chronic. So you can get your answers from here.
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:32.510
Himadri Lala
Means that the inner concept in a concept you can definitely read out means in each of these points OK. And apart from this side, if you booked it can also refer to what book one book is there.
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:33.690
Himadri Lala
Is.
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:41.000
Himadri Lala
William William hate. So if we just download the syllabus, the reference books are already mentioned over there.
00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:44.380
Himadri Lala
OK, so.
00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:50.560
Himadri Lala
Now, apart from that we previously like since the last.
00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:59.310
Himadri Lala
Last semester also we have done two experiments regarding this lab experiment, so previously there was a lab, yes.
00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:57.590
Anamika Shaoke
So.
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:05.110
Anamika Shaoke
Sorry, can you please repeat the second name of the book you recommended?
00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.860
Himadri Lala
Yes, yes, it's William hate.
00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.720
Himadri Lala
80 yd.
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.580
Anamika Shaoke
OK.
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:13.810
Himadri Lala
OK, if you just download the syllabus, it is mentioned over there.
00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:16.280
Anamika Shaoke
OK Sir.
00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:28.750
Himadri Lala
So generally these are about experiments. Generally we used to do. Now Mr. Mr. We don't have any lab with this along with this. So what we are going to do some of the problems I will show you how to solve it in MATLAB.
00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:43.340
Himadri Lala
Now now whenever I'm saying so, it is not at all essential to use MATLAB if you are compatible with any others programming language, like if you want to use Python or something else. So definitely you can go with it.
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:52.060
Himadri Lala
OK, Michael is only on for mentioning only. I'm saying otherwise you can use any software means suppose.
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.630
Himadri Lala
Uh.
00:19:53.800 --> 00:20:00.850
Himadri Lala
OK, so let me ask you one thing. So what we did here for two DA, one person or one V2 clicks.
00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:08.510

For two, behave one quiz.
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.840
Himadri Lala
Cool.
00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.660
Himadri Lala
Weaver is having.
00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:16.020
Himadri Lala
Agreement on this. So can you please raise your hands?
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:17.980
Himadri Lala
Sudhir one, please?
00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:45.870
Himadri Lala
Do you want this? OK, OK, I think most of those games are actually OK, so we'll be having two D A1 phase, but there will be a small small things, small difference. Instead of giving just like small problems and few problems or copying.
00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.590
Himadri Lala
Each other, So what I'll give you.
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:59.210
Himadri Lala
2 problems which will also build some kind of programming knowledge. Any modes OK means what you have to do. You have to solve it mathematically. Also we have to do the coding.
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:05.160
Himadri Lala
OK, but I think it won't take much time and if you face any problem, definitely help you out.
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:06.290
Himadri Lala
OK.
00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:12.570
Himadri Lala
But I'm not that compatible in Python, but definitely Matlab, definitely. I think you are.
00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:23.210
Himadri Lala
OK, but it is not not commensurate to do it in MATLAB. If you if you are comfortable in Python but lately.
00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:25.720
Himadri Lala
And.
00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:34.920
Himadri Lala
This is all about the syllabus, and today we're only going for introduction to next class. One work will be covering.
00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:46.120
Himadri Lala
Yeah, it's in models. OK, if you have any question now now one one last question on the important thing is I think you might have heard about this subject. This is very difficult or something.
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:48.490
Himadri Lala
OK, which indeed is true.
00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.450
Himadri Lala
Right now it's true that subject.
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:54.430
Himadri Lala
Now the question is why it is difficult.
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.170
Himadri Lala
Because the difficulty level comes.
00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:02.550
Himadri Lala
From the very first model we just look at this model.
00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:08.160
Himadri Lala
If things are difficult because it requires basic knowledge of vector analysis.
00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:15.020
Himadri Lala
And coordinate system we need to understand what is the coordinate system and how it works and how the victims is can be done.
00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.140
Himadri Lala
OK, did you know this module properly?
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.870
Himadri Lala
I think it will be the easiest subject.
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:36.780
Himadri Lala
OK, now mark my words. If you are very clear about vector analysis and coding system, I think it will be very much easy for you to understand any concept.
00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:41.090
Himadri Lala
Because not a rocket science, and you know only.
00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:46.010
Himadri Lala
In fact, syllables you have to only study four equations.
00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:53.140
Himadri Lala
Saying, surprise, this is the four Maxwell's equation. These says the important.
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:56.940
Himadri Lala
This is before it covers the entire series.
00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:03.970
Himadri Lala
His four Maxwell situation covers the impact, delivers and apart from that it will moderate analogy construct any problem.
00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.600
Himadri Lala
You're very clear about.
00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:12.270
Himadri Lala
So what you have to do, my suggestion is whenever I'm suppose I'm I'm.
00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:22.920
Himadri Lala
And eating something. Try to practice problems. Don't wait. OK Sir, as solve only 5 problems. But please solve more problems it is it is not going to help you.
00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:27.790
Himadri Lala
Try to solve more problems you face problem then definitely ask me.
00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:33.220
Himadri Lala
Something was to keep on practicing because in the end mission only problems will.
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:37.580
Himadri Lala
Only problems will come.
00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:43.740
Himadri Lala
Small small carry one or two near term, but maximum 80% to 90% question will come.
00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.310
Himadri Lala
This problems.
00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:49.810
Himadri Lala
OK, so my suggestion is suppose you are buying.
00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:02.140
Himadri Lala
Getting in practice problem or some kind of example is there.
00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:17.740
Himadri Lala
After that example, there is one more that is active exercise. So which is which is very much similar to that example. So always solve all these problems first. Then after solving that problem you can directly you want to the exercises.
00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.430
Himadri Lala
I'm solve as much problem you.
00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:31.020
Himadri Lala
And it is going to help me with throughout your throughout your engineering period. This subject is very important.
00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:35.110
Himadri Lala
OK, and if you're very much clear about it, I think.
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:43.160
Himadri Lala
It can give you any. It could be really fun for you to understand electrical machines. It could be really understand this.
00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:50.450
Himadri Lala
OK, now don't worry about the difficulty, so that difficulty together we can end.
00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:52.080
Himadri Lala
Which I think will happen.
00:24:52.740 --> 00:25:01.100
Himadri Lala
OK, just my impression is try to give more focus on the vector analysis which you are lying some. If you have doubt so please get it cleared.
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:10.900
Himadri Lala
And don't shy away from asking question. I'm open to any game system through any kinds of questions.
00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.680
Himadri Lala
No question is stupid, everything is earlier.
00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:15.690
Himadri Lala
K.
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:25.170
Himadri Lala
Or do you need to ask? Sometimes you may hire for sale from asking questions that don't do it because at the end of the day you are going to.
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.980
Himadri Lala
Yeah, that's right. Before we just do some arrangements so that we don't.
00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:40.060
Himadri Lala
Is your face any problem? Definitely you can reach out to me through email and also through Ms teams chats.
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.310
Himadri Lala
Any question you can ask.
00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:49.270
Himadri Lala
Send out any question.
00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:50.190
Anamika Shaoke
So.
00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.240
Himadri Lala
Yes.
00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:55.720
Anamika Shaoke
So do you will provide us with the nodes or we have to make them?
00:25:57.130 --> 00:26:08.430
Himadri Lala
Bomba make notes. I'll give you some things that I have. OK, I'll do whatever I'll be teaching and give you the paper and rest of the things. Don't wait for me, just follow the book.
00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:14.760
Himadri Lala
I can make better notes than the book. The book is very good.
00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:17.150
Anamika Shaoke
OK Sir.
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:18.100
Himadri Lala
Yeah.
00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:23.660
Sakshi Agrawal
So do we have to solve questions on her own or build? We do some in class as well?
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:25.190
Himadri Lala
Yes, yes, definitely.
00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:27.750
Himadri Lala
Most of the time will be solving problems in.
00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.950
Sakshi Agrawal
Also it also one request. Surya voice isn't very clear, it's a.
00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:41.250
Himadri Lala
Yes, yes I can understand. Yeah, right? So I'm taking this from my travel. So from next day onwards.
00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:43.340
Himadri Lala
2nd.
00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:45.090
Sakshi Agrawal
Thank you Sir.
00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:58.570
Himadri Lala
And one more thing, one more thing. Suppose suppose by voice, now voice is low because other other packages also worked. That's why I kept it like that. So if it is not audible, please inform him to the class.
00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:03.790
Himadri Lala
Anytime you can interact with inconsistent, your voice is not clear.
00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.410
Himadri Lala
It will wait for the end, otherwise we'll miss something.
00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:11.450
Piyush Dubey
OK, so.
00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:14.580
Himadri Lala
OK, OK so anything else? Any other question?
00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:16.660
Piyush Dubey
No, Sir.
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:22.670
Himadri Lala
OK, OK which brings us to the end of this class, so thank you.
00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.220
Himadri Lala
Thank you so much.
00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.170
Piyush Dubey
Right?
00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.150
Himadri Lala
I think some of you I I think.
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:37.030
Himadri Lala
Join just last few minutes report. I don't know why it didn't happen, but don't do it because we get that means it means it's not important.
00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:38.930
Himadri Lala
Hey.
00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:42.020
Himadri Lala
But if you don't learn anything.
00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:42.040
Abhay Saini
That actually.
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:55.710
Abhay Saini
Actually I was joined to someone other meeting Sir. It was showing in my calendar so that's why I means no teacher was coming. So after some time I look down here.
00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:57.100
Himadri Lala
OK OK OK, no issues, no issues. Next time onwards I think it won't happen.
00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.810
Himadri Lala
So don't worry, don't worry about it.
00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:02.850
Himadri Lala
This focus on the class.
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.740
Himadri Lala
But it is important thing is.
00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.950
Himadri Lala
He's been living with more attentive. OK, so thank you so much.
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:15.370
Himadri Lala
And if you face any problem, so please reach out. Thank you.
00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.880
Himadri Lala
Thank you so much. I mean I hope you have a great day. Thank you.
00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:20.890
Abhay Saini
Thank you Sir.
